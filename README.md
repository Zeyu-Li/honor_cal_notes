### Note about this course and my experience

----

My school had an extraordinary honors calculus year. The main prof left by second semester and a German prof can in to sub, but, because of his Germanicness (he literally goes off of a German textbook), it was difficult to follow his sometimes rigorous and sometimes not rigorous (he called them trivial) proofs.
