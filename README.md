## About

This is a summery of **Honors Calculus** (117 + 118) (or as some people call it: "**Abstract Calculus**")
This course will focus on set theory and number theory (and logic)

2. Logic
3. What is a number? (It's not what you think it is)
4. Induction
5. Absolute values
6. Intervals and bounds
7. Real numbers
8. Sequences and limits
9. Functions (and notation)
10. Continuity
11. 1-sided limits
12. min/max and sup/inf
13. Rolle's theorem
14. Intermediate value theorem
15. Mean value theorem (Meme value theorem)
16. Differentiation
17. First and second derivative test
18. L'Hopital's Rule (Le hospital)
19. Taylor's Theorem
20. Convex and concave
21. Inverse functions
22. Implicit differentiation
23. Exponentials and logs
24. Logarithmic differentiation



## Notes

#### 0. Shorthand

Ex. $\to$ example

Thm $\to$ Theorem (will be in block quotes)

##### Formal Logic

$\in \to$ element of

$\sub \to$ subset of

$\cup \to$ union

$\cap \to$ intercept



$\and \to$ and

$\or \to$ or

$\to\ \to$ then

$\iff \to$ if and only if (this is the same as =)

$=: \to$ is defined to be



$\forall \to$ for all

$\exist \to$ there exists

$\exist! \to$ there exists unique



$Q.E.D. \to$ and is is proved



##### Fields

$\N \to$ natural numbers (i.e. 1,2,3,4...) [\* note 0 might be included in natural numbers depending on what text book is in use]

$W \to$ whole numbers ($\{0\} \cup \N$) 

$\Z \to$ integers (i.e. ..-2,-1,0,1,2...)

$\Q \to$ Rational numbers (anything that can be expressed as $\frac{p}{q}, where\ p\in\Z\ and \ q\in\N$)

$\R \to$ will be discussed later

#### 1. Sets

a set is defined as a number (can be 0 but then that would be the trivial or stupid set) of elements belonging to the same group

### Note about this course and my experience

----

My school had an extraordinary honors calculus year. The main prof left by second semester and a German prof can in to sub, but, because of his Germanicness (he literally goes off of a German textbook), it was difficult to follow his sometimes rigorous and sometimes not rigorous (he called them trivial) proofs. 

Also, at my university, compute 272 is trivially similar to 117.
